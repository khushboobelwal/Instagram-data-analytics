# Fraud Detection 

Fraud detection is crucial for safeguarding financial integrity. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a vital tool in this endeavor, enabling analysts to sift through vast datasets to spot anomalies and potential fraud. This description outlines a comprehensive approach to fraud detection using SQL, focusing on data preparation, anomaly detection, and automated monitoring.

Goals
### Spot anomalies : Identify transactions that diverge from typical patterns.
### Detect patterns: Uncover transaction sequences that suggest fraudulent activity.
### Automate alerts: Develop SQL scripts to flag suspicious transactions in real-time.
